# Lookup Service

For example, for the tournaments I also need to implement the LookupService logic,
so these things get translated to something readable on the frontend:

```json
    "weight": 1,
    "game_mode": 1,
    "format_type": 1,
    "event_type": 1,
    "prize_currency": 1,
    "structure": 1,
```
